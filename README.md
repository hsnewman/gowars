GOWARS
Gowars is a reverse engineering project to revive the historic DECWAR game that was written at the University of Texas at Austin by Bob Hysick and Jeff Potter around 1979.  An online version is available at gowars.net port 1701.

Description
The code for DECWAR has been lost. Gowars is based on the 2.2 version of the executable and documentation that was released by DECUS.  There are minor differences between the original game and Gowars including:
  An improved command line interface:
    Command history
    Parameter parsing
    Command line editing
  The list command does not support:
    And             Used to separate groups of keywords.
    &               Same as AND.
  Support for multiple concurrent games at once (with different sizes)
  An optional modern version (gowars mode) that supports:
    Tractoring non-ships
    A different "fog of war".  
    Towing of any object
