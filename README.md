GOWARS
Gowars is a reverse engineering project to revive the historic DECWAR game that was written at the University of Texas at Austin by Bob Hysick and Jeff Potter around 1979.  An online version is available at gowars.net port 1701.

Description
The code for DECWAR has been lost. Gowars is based on the 2.2 version of the executable and documentation that was released by DECUS.  There are minor differences between the original game and Gowars including:
  The activate command has additional parameters allowing defining the side your want to be on, if the galaxy is empty what size the galaxy is, how many of each object should be in the galaxy, and the max number of bases per side.
  The admin command allows for many testing commands
  The time output includes the time since creation for the galaxy your in
  The users command outputs information for tcp/ip
  The type output and type options commands is updated for more information for Gowars
  For all situational awareness commands (list/bases/planets etc), decwar's information is based on what other ships have "listed".  Gowars mode is based on all objects within range of a friendly ship.  
  
  An improved command line interface:  
    Supporting command history  
    Command line editing  
    Parameter parsing  
    Special characters:  
      Enter: Submit command.  
      Backspace/Delete: Delete last character.  
      Ctrl+A (ASCII 1): Move cursor to beginning of line.  
      Ctrl+B (ASCII 2): Move cursor left.  
      Ctrl+C(ASCII 3): Cancel command queue and interrupt output.  
      Ctrl+E (ASCII 5): Move cursor to end of line.  
      Ctrl+F (ASCII 6): Move cursor right.  
      Ctrl+K (ASCII 11): Delete to end of line.  
      Ctrl+L (ASCII 12): Clears the terminal screen.  
      Tab (ASCII 9): Command/parameter completion.  
      Escape (ASCII 27): Command completion or repeat last command.  
     
  The list command does not support:  
    And             Used to separate groups of keywords.  
    &               Same as AND.  
  Support for multiple concurrent games at once (with different sizes)  
  An optional modern version (gowars mode) that supports:  
    Tractoring non-ships  
    A different "fog of war".
